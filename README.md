# GameUsed_All_OOP_Concepts
this project is a turn-base This game is a simulation that operates according to the parameters setted at the beginning.The reason of development is learning and practicing about OOP concepts (Inheritence, Interface, Overwrite etc...), writing rotating algorithm and graphical development.
